The GravityModule mod, created by SteinsGateSG, is a mod that adds the ability to animate PO objects with a gravity effect. It provides a UI for users to set all important parameters, such as gravity acceleration, initial speed and rebound factor. All effects by this mod allow users to create amazing stuff and may push the game to a new level.
